# Python-Job-Market-Analysis-Using-API-Python-Project
Developed a Python-based data extraction and analysis solution to evaluate job demand for selected programming technologies. The project retrieves real-time job posting data from an external API, processes key skill information, and generates a structured Excel report summarizing technology demand.

# Key Tasks Performed:

Extracted job posting data from an online API using the requests library
Parsed JSON response data for analysis
Implemented a reusable function to count job postings by technology
Performed case-insensitive keyword matching for accurate skill detection
Automated data aggregation for multiple technologies (Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, SQL)
Structured results into a Pandas DataFrame
Exported analyzed results into an Excel file using openpyxl
Automated report generation for business insights

# Tools & Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Requests (API integration)
OpenPyXL (Excel automation)

# Business Insight:

This project helps identify market demand trends for various programming technologies, supporting data-driven career or hiring decisions.
